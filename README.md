A simple avatar generator based on the idea of [yurkth](https://github.com/yurkth/sprator).

I found it much simplier to just create a noise and not to do some cellular automata as post-processing.
Depending on the random function the results are incredible different.

For this quick release only HTML tables are rendered, but it is kept open to enhance for more renderers.
